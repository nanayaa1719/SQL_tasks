-- Description: Basic SQL statements to get started

-- Creating a simple table
CREATE TABLE employees (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    first_name VARCHAR(50),
    last_name VARCHAR(50),
    department VARCHAR(50),
    salary DECIMAL(10,2),
    hire_date DATE
);

-- Inserting sample data
INSERT INTO employees (first_name, last_name, department, salary, hire_date)
VALUES
('John', 'Doe', 'HR', 50000, '2020-06-15'),
('Jane', 'Smith', 'IT', 70000, '2019-03-10'),
('Michael', 'Brown', 'Finance', 80000, '2018-08-23'),
('Emily', 'Davis', 'IT', 65000, '2021-01-05');

-- Selecting all employees
SELECT * FROM employees;

-- Selecting specific columns
SELECT first_name, last_name, salary FROM employees;

-- Filtering data using WHERE
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE department = 'IT';

-- Sorting results
SELECT * FROM employees ORDER BY salary DESC;

-- Aggregation: Counting employees
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_employees FROM employees;

-- Aggregation: Finding average salary per department
SELECT department, AVG(salary) AS avg_salary
FROM employees
GROUP BY department;

-- Using HAVING to filter grouped results
SELECT department, AVG(salary) AS avg_salary
FROM employees
GROUP BY department
HAVING AVG(salary) > 60000;
